    <h1>Paced Repetition Method</h1>
    <img src="../img/rep.jpg" alt="">
    <ul> Ingredients:

        <li>Study materials (textbooks, notes, flashcards)</li>
        <li>Timer or stopwatch</li>
        <li>Quiet study environment</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
    Instructions:
        <li>Begin by organizing your study materials into smaller chunks or flashcards.</li>
        <li>Set a timer for a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 20 minutes).</li>
        <li>Start studying a set of flashcards or a particular section of the material.</li>
        <li>Once the timer goes off, take a short break and put the studied material aside.</li>
        <li>After a brief break, review the same set of flashcards or material again.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process of studying and reviewing the material at gradually increasing intervals.</li>
        <li>For example, review the material again after a day, then after a few days, a week, and so on.</li>
        <li>Focus more on the flashcards or sections that are more challenging to reinforce learning.</li>
        <li>Continue reviewing the material periodically, spacing out the intervals based on your understanding and retention.</li>
        <li>The spaced repetition method helps in strengthening long-term memory and retaining information effectively over time.
