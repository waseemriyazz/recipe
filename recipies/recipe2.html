    <h1>Pomodoro Technique</h1>
    <ul> Ingredients:

        <li>Study materials (textbooks, notes, flashcards)</li>
        <li>Timer or stopwatch</li>
        <li>Notebook or paper for jotting down distractions</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
    Instructions:
        <li>Set a timer for 25 minutes (this is known as one "Pomodoro").</li>
        <li>Focus solely on studying for the entire duration without any distractions.</li>
        <li>If distractions or unrelated thoughts arise, jot them down on a separate piece of paper without engaging with them.</li>
        <li>Once the timer goes off, take a short 5-minute break.</li>
        <li>During the break, stretch, move around, or do something enjoyable and unrelated to studying.</li>
        <li>After the break, start another Pomodoro by setting the timer for 25 minutes and repeating the focused study session.</li>
        <li>After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break of around 15-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat this cycle of focused studying and short breaks until you've covered your study goals for the session.</li>
        <li>The Pomodoro Technique helps to improve concentration, manage time effectively, and maintain productivity during study sessions.</li>
    </ol>
